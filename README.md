RAT IN MAZE PROBLEM

Simple Rat in Maze problem in python programming language.

This code solves the Maze problem using Backtracking.It mainly uses solveMazeUtil() to solve the problem. 
It  returns false if no path is possible, otherwise return  true and prints the path in the form of 1s.
There may be more than one solution, this code prints one of the feasible solutions.
A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
